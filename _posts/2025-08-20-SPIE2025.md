## Stray and Scattered Light Considerations in a Non-contiguous Array of Commercial CMOS Sensors in a Space Mission

Recent advances in CMOS technology have potential to significantly increase the performance, at low-cost, of an astronomical space telescope. Arrays of sensors in space missions are typically contiguous and act as a monolithic detector. A non-contiguous array, with gaps between individual commercial CMOS detectors, offers potential cost and schedule benefits but poses a unique challenge for stray/scattered light mitigation due to complexities in the optomechanics. For example, if the array of detectors is being fed a large field of view, then each detector will have a different angle of incidence. Any individual bandpass filters need to be held perpendicular to the incoming beam so as not to create variances of central wavelength transmission from detector to detector. It naturally follows that the optical design can force filter ghosts to fall between detectors. When dealing with well-focused, high-intensity beams, first and second order stray light path analyses must be conducted to determine scattered light from glints off of individual optics/opto-mechanics or detector specific vane structures. More mechanical structures are necessary for imaging with non-contiguous arrays, all of which have potential to increase scattered light. This proceeding will document various stray light mitigation strategies for a non-contiguous array of sensors in a space telescope.

NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aims to achieve starlight suppression to the $10^{-10}$ level for the detection and spectral characterization of Earth-like exoplanets. Broadband ozone absorption features are key biosignatures that appear in the 200-400nm near-ultraviolet (UV) regime. Extending coronagraphy from visible wavelengths to the UV, however, brings with it a number of challenges, including tighter requirements on wavefront sensing and control, optical surface quality, scattered light, and polarization aberrations, among other things. We aim to partially quantify and address these challenges with a combination of modeling, high-resolution metrology to the scales required for UV coronagraphy, and—ultimately—a demonstration of UV coronagraphy on the Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB) vacuum testbed. In these proceedings, we provide a status update on our modeling and contrast budgeting efforts, characterization efforts to understand performance limitations set by key optical components, and our plans to move toward a demonstration of UV coronagraphy.

The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) coronagraph instrument will need to block starlight so effectively that only one in every $10^{10}$ photons reaching the telescope makes it to the science camera. Otherwise, light from a planet orbiting the star will be buried below the level of the starlight. This is about 100 times the performance of the current generation of space coronagraphs, requiring a significant advancement in starlight rejection. At such extreme contrasts, every optical component must be analyzed for leakage due to imperfections in manufacturing or even the underlying physics that can cause unwanted starlight to reach the science camera. For components with small features, the interaction of the electric and magnetic fields with interfaces of different materials can lead to starlight leakage that may limit performance. This paper considers the Lyot occulter, a small metal dot used by the Lyot family of coronagraph instruments to block the image of a star from reaching the science camera. We use a numerical simulation of Maxwell's equations to estimate the impact of various Lyot occulter geometries on starlight leakage. With these results, we find that starlight leakage from Lyot occulting masks is a non-negligible but mitigatable source of leakage at the required level of performance for the HWO.
