For this study, we present a method for performing an autonomous alignment of a three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) telescope on orbit. The motivation for this study comes from the want to explore options to align the TMA on orbit post-deployment while keeping relative cost to science ratio low. The detector used in the TMA under study provides us with a large field of view (FOV). With a large FOV provided in the design, we can use many stars as sample points to drive this alignment knowing how the average size of the star across the detector changes as a function of moving the secondary mirror (M2). Adjustment of the secondary mirror will happen in a multi-stage procedure, starting with a coarse alignment with a large range of motion, and ending with a finer alignment driven by small, random perturbations of M2. For testing this algorithm, we generate a set of possible misalignment cases of the telescope and test how the multi-stage procedure aligns the telescope from a highly misaligned state to a point at which finer alignment can take over to begin science observations.
